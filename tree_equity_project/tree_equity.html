        <h1>Chicago is Lacking in Canopy Cover Compared to Other Cities</h1>
        <p>Many cities across the country have significantly higher canopy levels than Chicago and have set goals to
            increase their canopy cover. Chicago currently does not have a target to which it aims to increase its urban canopy.

        <h1>The Distribution of Trees in Chicago is not Equitable</h1>
        <p>American Forests has created a 'Tree Equity Score' for cities and neighborhoods across the country. This equity score 
            takes into account current canopy cover, population density, poverty rates, racial demographics, health metrics, and 
            summer surface temperatures. Many neighborhoods in the southwest parts of Chicago scored a low Tree Equity Score.

        <h1>Over the last 10 years Chicago Planted Trees in Places with the Least Need</h1>
        <p>This chart shows the number of trees planted per street mile between 2011 and 2021 in each Chicago neighborhood.
            More trees were planted in areas with a higher Tree Equity Score, meaning the trees were planted in neighborhoods that
            already had more canopy, were cooler, richer, and had fewer people of color.
