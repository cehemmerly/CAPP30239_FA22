        <h2>
            Urban Tree Canopy is an Important Resource for City Residents
        </h2>       
        <p>Urban tree canopy is a highly beneficial resource with the potential to significantly improve quality of life for urban residents. Urban tree canopy has been shown to decrease urban heat island effects, reduce flooding, and improve air quality. Additionally, studies have shown that access to trees can improve both mental and physical health.</p>

    <p>Chicago’s urban tree canopy is significantly lower than many other US cities, with only 17% of the city's area currently covered by trees. This tree cover is below comparable cities like New York (22%) and LA (24%) and far below cities like Atlanta (47%) and Pittsburgh (42%). Many cities, including the four just listed, have implemented ambitious canopy cover goals to increase their urban canopy. According to Vibrant Cities Lab, Chicago has a goal to reach 25% tree canopy cover, which is one of the lowest goals reported.</p>

            <h2>Over the Last 10 Years Chicago has Destroyed More Trees than it has Planted</h2>
            <div id="diverging-chart" class="float-right chart"></div>
            <p>According to reporting from 
                <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/environment/ct-chicago-trees-equity-20220612-prpuxgsabzc2fa4fnwnyf4fbku-story.html">The Chicago Tribune,</a>
                since 2011 Chicago has been destroying more trees that it is planting each year. It was not clear from the city records why the trees were removed, although the article noted that <b>tree damage from the Emerald Ash Borer beetle, as well as extreme weather due to climate change were cited by the city as the main cause for tree removal</b>.
            </p>
            <p>The Emerald Ash Borer is an invasive species of beetles that is responsible for killing 30 million trees in the northeastern US and Canada. The beetle larvae feed under the bark and outer sapwood of the ash tree, producing tunnels that eventually kill branches and entire trees. The Emerald Ash Borer poses a severe threat to the Chicago canopy as 85,000 trees on the public right-of-way are susceptible Ash trees, as well as an additional 300,000 trees on private property.<sup>6</sup> While the city may eventually be able to replace trees killed by the beetle, new saplings have significantly smaller canopies than older trees and it will take decades for the saplings to grow sufficiently to fully replace the lost canopy cover.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that reported records on tree plantings and removal are from the Chicago Bureau of Forestry on Chicago public right-of-way and do not include records of tree plantings or removal on private property.</p>

            <h1>The Distribution of Trees in Chicago is not Equitable</h1>
            <p>American Forests, a nation-wide non-profit, which works to conserve and restore forests in the United States, recently released its Tree Equity Score project. This project evaluates the equitable access to trees in cities in the US. Each region receives its own tree equity scores based on current levels of canopy and socio-economic demographics. The lower the score, the higher the priority that area should be for new tree plantings.
            </p>
            <h4>What goes into the Tree Equity Score: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A canopy target based on natural biome (is the city in a region of the country with naturally high forest cover, like Philadelphia, or in a desert, like Las Vegas?)</li>
                <li>The current level of canopy</li>
                <li>Population density</li>

        <p><b>Neighborhoods on Chicago’s south and west sides have significantly lower Tree Equity Scores</b> than neighborhoods on the north side of the city. To anyone familiar with Chicago, this is an unsurprising statistic. The neighborhoods on the south and west sides typically have a higher proportion of people of color and higher poverty rates. These neighborhoods also have historically experienced significant disinvestment and lack of support from the city, while the wealther neighborhoods on the north side have received many more resources.</p> 
        <h2>Over the last 10 years Chicago Planted Trees in Places with the Least Need</h2>
        <p>The below chart shows a comparison of the number of trees planted per street mile of a neighborhood between 2011 and 2021 and the Tree Equity Score of that neighborhood. The size of the circle represents the proportion of each neighborhood that is people of color, with larger circles indicating a higher percentage. The color of the circle demonstrates the average summer temperature. Cooler temperatures are in blue and hotter temperatures are in red.

        </div>

        <div id="scatter"></div>
        <p>The comparison of neighborhood tree plantings and neighborhood Tree Equity Scores shows that more trees were planted in areas with higher Tree Equity Scores. Based on how the Tree Equity Scores were calculated, this means that <b>new trees were planted in areas that already had higher canopies levels, were wealthier, and had fewer people of color</b>. As such, the recent history of tree planting in Chicago, indicates that the city is doing little to address equity issues around access to urban canopy, and may actually be exacerbating these issues.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Roots Chicago</h2>
        <p>Early in 2022 the city announced its Our Roots Chicago program, as part of the city’s Climate Action Plan. This program has a goal of planting 75,000 trees across the city, with a focus on addressing equity issues, by planting trees in the areas with the most need. This is an important first step to improving the urban canopy in the city. However, more funding, advocacy, and resources will likely be necessary to continue long term improvements.</p>
    <h2>Data Visualization and Story Process</h2>
    <p>I chose this topic because, as a Chicago resident I see the benefit of living in a neighborhood with a lot of trees every day. I have also seen first hand the drastic change in canopy when going through neighborhoods in the poorer areas of the city. I started this project by looking into canopy equity in Chicago and obtained data on equity from <a href="https://www.treeequityscore.org/map/#10.31/41.852/-87.5946">treeequityscore.org</a>. Continuing to search for supplemental information I found the data from <a href="https://www.vibrantcitieslab.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tree-Canopy-Goals-US-2014.pdf">Vibrant Cities Lab</a> and the reporting from <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/environment/ct-chicago-trees-equity-20220612-prpuxgsabzc2fa4fnwnyf4fbku-story.html">The Chicago Tribune </a>on recent tree plantings in the city. This helped me create the story to place Chicago in the context of other cities and visualize recent struggles with canopy cover and equity in access to trees.</p>
    <p>For the first three charts I chose simple graphs that I felt clearly communicated the information I wanted to present. I chose the green color scheme for each of them because I wanted to invoke the feeling of greenery from trees in the viewer. For the bar chart, I chose to specifically highlight Chicago with its own color, as well as use the empty bars for the city goals, to try to visualize that these were targets that have yet to be met. In the diverging area chart, I added the annotation about the ash borer beetle, because I felt that it really helped to tell the story about why there was an abrupt change in the net number of trees.</p>    
    <p>I chose a scatter plot to demonstrate where trees were planted in the context of the tree equity score. I chose this chart type because I felt that it would be able to communicate a lot of different information in one place. I feel that using color helped to highlight both the benefit of urban trees in mitigating urban heat island effects and to communicate that trees were being planted in areas that were already cool. The circle size I felt was valuable to highlight inequity in the city. Chicago is still highly segregated and I felt that the circle size representing the proportion of people of color would help to emphasize the continuing lack of resources those communities receive.</p>
    <p>I experimented with making some of the graphs interactive. In particular ,the bar chart I considered the option to select how it was sorted and in the scatter plot I wanted the viewer to be able to select which Tree Equity Score inputs were used to create the size and the color of the circles. However, I ultimately chose to keep the charts static. I felt that there was enough information being displayed to clearly tell the story and that the interactivity would be distracting and potentially overwhelming without adding enough value.</p>
