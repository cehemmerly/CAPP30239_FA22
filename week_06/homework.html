        <h1>Police Killings by State in 2015</h1>
        <p>This is a simple chart looking at the number of police killings per 100,000 people in each state. 
            The purpose of the chart was to evaluate which states have the most police killings. I used a sorted horizontal bar 
            chart to be able to see the states ranked most to least in number of killings per 100,000 people. Ideally, with more
            time I would like to add some annotations and interaction. I would like to add annotation of the country level
            killings per 100,000 to add context to the number for each state. I would also like to be able to filter by race if I
            had population numbers for each state.

        <h1>Most People of Color Killed by Police are in Their 20's and 30's</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this chart is to examine the ages of most people killed by police. I used a histogram to see the distribution
            of ages. I added the interaction of filtering by race because I wanted to see if there is a difference in the ages of people
            killed by race. There is actually a noticable difference in the distribution of the ages of black and hispanic people compared 
            to white people. There are signficantly more black and hispanic people killed in their 20's, compared with white people, where 
            the ages are more evenly distributed around 30-40.

        <h1>The Majority of People Killed are Armed with a Gun</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this chart evaluate if people killed by police are typically armed and if so, what they are armed with. 
            I used a ring chart to see the relative proportion of weapons being weilded by people killed. I felt like a ring chart was
            appropriate in the case because the it clearly shows how many people are weilding guns compared to being unarmed or wielding a 
            different weapon. This is another case where I would have liked to add the interaction with race to continue evaluating the 
            differences in how people are killed by race, if I had more time.
