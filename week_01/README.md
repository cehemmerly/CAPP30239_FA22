# Claire Hemmerly

Hi! My name is Claire and I'm a master's student at the University of Chicago. I'm completing a degree in Compulational Analysis and Public Policy with a focus on energy and environmental policy. I have a background in hard science and have previously completed a masters degree in Oceanography. I also spent time working in research and development in the pharmaceutical industry before returning to school. In my free time I like to do yoga, ride my bike, and go backpacking. I also enjoy painting and baking.
