"How are cities pledging net zero? A computational approach to analyzing subnational climate strategies"

Hsu, Angel; Sachdeva, Sidd; French, Ian; Lim, Elwin, 2022, "Replication Data for: How are cities pledging net zero? A computational approach to analyzing subnational climate strategies", [https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/6VB8BC](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15139/S3/6VB8BC), UNC Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Oyc7WCNsKPU26Njmm1UYFw== [fileUNF]

## Interest
I'm particularly interested in this topic because cities have a significant role to play in addressing climate change. City policy has the potential to be more aggressive towards addressing climate issues than federal policy, potentially pushing for more federal action. There is also the potential for a range of policies that are more effective at a local level than federal policy may be. 

## Plans to Use Data and Potiential Data Points
  * Map location of cities that have net-zero polices or pledges
  * Demonstrate the initiatives that exist to lower emissions and how many cities have pledged to meet them
  * Highlight cities with them most aggressive targets and extensive policies
  * Show the actual progress towards meeting goals that have been setting
  * Visualize the most frequently used paths to lower emisisions
  * Potentially highlight any unique or creative policies to address climate issues

## Concerns
I have minimal concerns about this data. The data is extensive and well formatted.

## Source Type
This is my primary source.
