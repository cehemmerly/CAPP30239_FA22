# Dear Data
I tracked the positive interactions I had with my partners during the week. I recorded the amount of time spent together and each interaction we had. I categorized the interactions by type of love language I felt like we were using. To visualize the data, I created vines to represent each day, following the vine from top to bottom takes you through my day and each interaction I had. Long vines show the days I spent almost entirely with a partner, whereas the shortest vine show's a day where I was almost entirely on my own or with other people.
